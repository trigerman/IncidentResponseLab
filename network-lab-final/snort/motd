#   Your network is under ACTIVE attack!                        #

#   üö© Intrusion Detection Systems have raised multiple alarms. #
#   üö© Suspicious network traffic is flooding into this server. #
#                                                               #

#                                                               #

#   1. Investigate the network traffic carefully.               #
#   2. Identify the attacker's IP address (last octet).         #
#   3. Detect the payload signature used in the attack.         #
#   4. Identify the target port number.                         #
#                                                               #
#   Once you have the flag type "found" in terminal             #
#   Then type the flag when asked                               #
#                                                               #
#   üëâ Flag Format: <payload>_<last_octet>_<port>               #
#      Example: shadow_2_8080                                   #
